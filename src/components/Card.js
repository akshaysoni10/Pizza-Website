          <h1>Margherita Pizza</h1>
          <p>
            Margherita pizza is known for its ingredients representing the
            colours of the Italian flag. These ingredients include red tomato
            sauce, white mozzarella and fresh green basil. When all of these
            delicious flavours are combined on a hand-kneaded pizza base, a
            universally-adored pizza is created.

          <p>
            Pepperoni pizza is an American pizza variety which includes one of
            the country's most beloved toppings. Pepperoni is actually a
            corrupted form of peperoni (one “p”), which denotes a large pepper
            in Italian, but nowadays it denotes a spicy salami, usually made
            with a mixture of beef, pork, and spices.

          <p>
            Chicago-style pizza usually refers to deep-dish pizza, which is a

            meat and vegetables, and sauce–in that order. The crust is usually
            two to three inches tall and gets slightly fried due to the oil in
            the pan.
